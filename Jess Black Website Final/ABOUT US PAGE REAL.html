      <p>
        <p>We are a group of students in all saints' collage who are trying to give to children in hospital by designing and hand making bracelets for them. We are being sustainable and using old jewellery that would have been thrown out as well as using recycled cardboard for packaging. These bracelets motivate children to get better soon so that when they get home they can were the bracelet that will give them joy.</p>

      <p>
        <p>The first thing we do is collect the beads from op shops and second hand shops like the salvation army and good Sammy's. by doing this we are preventing these beads from going to landfill and  giving them a second life. We then separate and sort the beads so that they can be recrafted. After that we design the bracelets with the available beads we do this on a jewellery tray. We then make the bracelet and package them with recycled cardboard, then we label it and deliver the bracelets to children in hospital. </p>

      <p>During this project we have learnt how to transform old and unwanted jewellery into new, beautiful and wanted Jewry. we have learnt how to make jewellery from recycled materials and we have  learnt how to be more sustainable by using and upcycling materials like old jewellery and recycled cardboard .One of the most major skills that we have learnt is how to give, we learnt that there are some people out there who are less fortunate as us but we can help them and we can bring happiness to there faces, and that is what we have done. </p></td>
